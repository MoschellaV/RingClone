## just some notes -- will clean up this readme

### for cameraAppliance
Note I built the camera appliance on a raspberry pi (specifically a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+)
So this setup process works for the Rasperry Pi OS

You must be have python 3.6+ (note I used python 3.9.16 while making this, but it should work for python 3.6+)

Set up virtual environemnt
python3.9 -m venv dev
source dev/bin/activate

To install requirements use pip3.9 install -r requirements.txt
To run the software for the camera use python3.9 main.py

### for server

you just need to run
npm install, to install all dependencies

### for client

you just need to run
npm install, to install all dependencies
